Step 1: Enable IP Forwarding on Host Z
First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on host Z. This allows the system to forward packets between interfaces.

# Enable IP forwarding for the current session
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Enable IP forwarding permanently by editing the sysctl configuration
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# Apply the changes
sudo sysctl -p

Step 2: Configure WireGuard Interfaces
On Host Z
Create and configure the WireGuard interface on host Z to accept connections from both host A and host B.

Create the WireGuard configuration file, e.g., /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf:

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <HostZ_PrivateKey>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <HostA_PublicKey>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <HostB_PublicKey>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32

Bring up the WireGuard interface:
sudo wg-quick up wg0

On Host A
Create and configure the WireGuard interface on host A to connect to host Z.

Create the WireGuard configuration file, e.g., /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf:

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <HostA_PrivateKey>
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <HostZ_PublicKey>
Endpoint = <HostZ_IP>:<HostZ_Port>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32, 10.0.0.3/32
Bring up the WireGuard interface:

sudo wg-quick up wg0
On Host B
Create and configure the WireGuard interface on host B to connect to host Z.

Create the WireGuard configuration file, e.g., /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf:

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <HostB_PrivateKey>
Address = 10.0.0.3/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <HostZ_PublicKey>
Endpoint = <HostZ_IP>:<HostZ_Port>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32, 10.0.0.2/32
Bring up the WireGuard interface:

sudo wg-quick up wg0
Step 3: Set Up IP Tables Rules on Host Z
To allow traffic to be forwarded between host A and host B, you need to set up appropriate iptables rules on host Z.

# Allow forwarding traffic from wg0 interface
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -o wg0 -j ACCEPT

# Allow traffic from host A to host B and vice versa
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.2/32 -d 10.0.0.3/32 -o wg0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.3/32 -d 10.0.0.2/32 -o wg0 -j MASQUERADE
Step 4: Persist iptables Rules
To make sure the iptables rules persist across reboots, you can save them using iptables-save or by using a tool like iptables-persistent.

# Save the iptables rules
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
Now, host Z should be properly configured to relay traffic between host A and host B using WireGuard.
